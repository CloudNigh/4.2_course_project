This project is created to modify the Craigslist website, making it more organized, user friendly, 
having the color scheme more pleasing to the eye, and convenient for users.

The website provides users access to many advertising categories on the site from buying houses to attending events. Users can also post advertisements to either sell their things or offer work.
